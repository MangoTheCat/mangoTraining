\title{
Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC)
}
\description{
The data contain measurements on cells in suspicious lumps in a women's breast.
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. All samples are classsified as either \emph{benign} or \emph{malignant}.
}
\usage{data(wdbc)}
\format{
\code{wdbc} is a \code{data.frame} with 31 columns. The first column indicates wether the sample is classified as benign (\code{B}) or malignant (\code{M}). The remaining columns contain measurements for 30 features.
}
\details{
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: \cr
    a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)  \cr
	b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) \cr
	c) perimeter \cr
	d) area \cr
	e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) \cr
	f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) \cr
	g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) \cr
	h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) \cr
	i) symmetry  \cr
	j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1) \cr
The references listed below contain detailed descriptions of
how these features are computed. 
The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
resulting in 30 features.
