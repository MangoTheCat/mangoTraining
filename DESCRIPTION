Description: Datasets to be used primarily in conjunction with Mango Solutions
    training materials but also for the book 'SAMS Teach Yourself R in 24 Hours' (ISBN: 978-0-672-33848-9).
    Version 1.0-7 is largely for use with the book; however, version 1.1 has a much greater focus on use with
    training materials, whilst retaining compatibility with the book.
